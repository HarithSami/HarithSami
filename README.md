**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Engineer/Artist)`**


Hi, I am Harith. Technical Designer at Criterion Games and a Mechatronics Engineer at the University of Leeds building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish that content on my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA9jGYuPfr4R4TnghOvC1YA) .
